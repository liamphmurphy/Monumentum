# Monumentum
Monumentum = 'Reminder' in Latin.

A small web app and back-end tool that reminds you when a show is about to air, depending on user input.

## Prerequisities
### Building
If you want to build Monumentum, you will need the following:

- go >= 1.10

- gcc

- github.com/BurntSushi/toml

- github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3


You can obtain the external libraries by running these commands WITH golang installed.
```
go get github.com/BurntSushi/toml
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```
go-sqlite3 requires gcc to build.


## Acknowledgments
Thank you BurntSushi and mattn for the libraries listed in the prerequisites section. Makes my life, and the lives of other golang programmers, much easier!
